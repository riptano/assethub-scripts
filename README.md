1. Add the simple-startup script to your asset root directory, from
   http://github.com/jshook/simple-startup/startup
2. Create your `.startup` scripts directory:
   `mkdir .startup`
3. Install this scripting repository as `.startup/managed-scripts`:
   `cd .startup ; git clone http://github.com/riptano/assethub-scripts managed-scripts`
